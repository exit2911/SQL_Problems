/*list & explain each of the ACID properties for database transactions

Atomicity : all or nothing. if one part of the transaction fails, the entire transaction fails. an atomic system must guarantee atomicity in every situation

Consistency: brings the database from one valid state to another. any data written to the database must be valid 

isolation: ensures executions to happen after one another. sequential 

durability: once a transaction has been committed, it will remain so*/
